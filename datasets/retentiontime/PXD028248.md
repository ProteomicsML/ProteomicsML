### Dataset Description
The full data contains 1 056 808 PSMs from a filtered (preselected columns and PEP < 0.001) evidence file from a MQ search.

Ascites and greater omentum tissue with metastatic lesions were collected from patients with 
ovarian HGSC undergoing primary surgery at the University Hospital in Marburg. 
Clinical courses were evaluated by RECIST criteria33 in patients with measurable disease or profiles
of serum CA125 levels according to the recommendations by the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG). Only
patients with observations periods ≥12 months after first line surgery were included in the survival.

Peptides were separated using an UHPLC (EASY-nLC 1000, ThermoFisher Scientific) and 20 cm, in-house packed C18 silica columns 
(1.9 μm C18 beads, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) coupled in line to a QExactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer 
(ThermoFisher Scientific) using an electrospray ionization source.

## sample protocol description:
See Dataset Description.

## data anaylsis protocol:
Analysis by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS2) was performed and peptide/spectrum matching as well as label 
free quantitation used the MaxQuant suite of algorithms against the human Uniprot database (canonical and isoforms; downloaded on 2020/02/05; 1888349 entries).
