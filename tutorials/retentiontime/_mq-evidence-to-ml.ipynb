    "In this tutorial you will learn how to go from MaxQuant evidence files to a data set that is ready for training a retention time prediction model. Retention time is the time it takes for an analyte travels through a column. The travel time depends on the interaction with the stationary phase (usually C18 for proteomics) and mobile phase. Where the mobile phase consists of solvents and changes in physicochemical properties over time with a predefined gradient. The stationary phase remains the same over time. This allows for peptides to elude at different time points, e.g., when it prefers to interact with the mobile phase at a certain percentage of the hydrophobic solvent."
