    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ion mobility is a technique to separate ionized analytes based on their size, shape, and physicochemical properties. Initially the techniques for ion mobility propelled the ions with an electric field through a cell with inert gas. The ions collide with the inert gas without fragmentation. Separation is achieved by propelling the ions faster or slower in the electric field (i.e., based on their charge) and are slowed down by the collisions with the gas (i.e., based on shape and size). Trapped ion mobility (TIMS) reverses this operation by trapping the ions in an electric field and forcing them forward by collision with the gas. From any of the different ion mobility techniques you are able to derive the collisional cross section (CCS) in Angstrom squared. In this notebook you can follow a short tutorial on how to train a Machine Learning model for the prediction of these CCS values."

In addition to these observations it seems that higher charge states have higher errors. This likely influenced by a large part by the relation between higher charge states and longer peptides. These longer peptides can deviate more from each other in terms of structures (and CCS). Instead of spending more time on this, lets have a look at a more ML-based approach."

    "With this model we are capable to predict CCS values for all three charge states (maybe more; be careful with extrapolation). However, it also shows that both z3 and z4 are not optimally predicted. Especially z4 we can probably draw a line manually that provides better performance than the current model. The incapability of the model to correctly predict some of these values is largely due to the linear algorithm. With this algorithm we can only fit \"simple\" linear relations, but more complex relations are not modeled correctly. In the next section we will fit a non-linear model that is able to capture these complex relations better. However, keep in mind that more complex models are usually also able to overfit data better, resulting in poorer generalization performance."

    "As can be observed the problem with z=4 splitting up is gone, probably due to the capability of RF to fit non-linear relations. However, we see quite a large deviation on the diagonal. One of the major causes of this problem is the exclusion of amino acid counts for the decision trees. Although this is fundamental to the inner workings of RF, it means that we cannot take the excluded amino acids into account and these values are likely to be replaced by average expected volume to other (non-excluded) amino acids. RF performs very well when features correlate, and predictions are not fully dependent on the inclusion of all features. Next we will look at a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) that does not rely on the exclusion of features.\n",
