  abstract = "SUMMARY: In metabolomics, rigorous structural identification of
              metabolites presents a challenge for bioinformatics. The use of
              collision cross-section (CCS) values of metabolites derived from
              ion mobility-mass spectrometry effectively increases the
              confidence of metabolite identification, but this technique
              suffers from the limit number of available CCS values. Currently,
              there is no software available for rapidly generating the
              metabolites' CCS values. Here, we developed the first web server,
              namely, MetCCS Predictor, for predicting CCS values. It can
              predict the CCS values of metabolites using molecular descriptors
              within a few seconds. Common users with limited background on
              bioinformatics can benefit from this software and effectively
              improve the metabolite identification in metabolomics.
              AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The web server is freely
              available at: http://www.metabolomics-shanghai.org/MetCCS/ .

  abstract = "We developed a resource, the Arabidopsis PeptideAtlas
              (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/arabidopsis/), to solve central
              questions about the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome, such as the
              significance of protein splice forms and post-translational
              modifications (PTMs), or simply to obtain reliable information
              about specific proteins. PeptideAtlas is based on published mass
              spectrometry (MS) data collected through ProteomeXchange and
              reanalyzed through a uniform processing and metadata annotation
              pipeline. All matched MS-derived peptide data are linked to
              spectral, technical, and biological metadata. Nearly 40 million
              out of ∼143 million MS/MS (tandem MS) spectra were matched to the
              reference genome Araport11, identifying ∼0.5 million unique
              peptides and 17,858 uniquely identified proteins (only isoform
              per gene) at the highest confidence level (false discovery rate
              0.0004; 2 non-nested peptides $\geq$9 amino acid each), assigned
              canonical proteins, and 3,543 lower-confidence proteins.
              Physicochemical protein properties were evaluated for targeted
              identification of unobserved proteins. Additional proteins and
              isoforms currently not in Araport11 were identified that were
              generated from pseudogenes, alternative start, stops, and/or
              splice variants, and small Open Reading Frames; these features
              should be considered when updating the Arabidopsis genome.
              Phosphorylation can be inspected through a sophisticated PTM
              viewer. PeptideAtlas is integrated with community resources
              including TAIR, tracks in JBrowse, PPDB, and UniProtKB.

  abstract = "Trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) is a relatively new
              gas-phase separation method that has been coupled to quadrupole
              orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The
              TIMS analyzer is a segmented rf ion guide wherein ions are
              mobility-analyzed using an electric field that holds ions
              stationary against a moving gas, unlike conventional drift tube
              ion mobility spectrometry where the gas is stationary. Ions are
              initially trapped, and subsequently eluted from the TIMS analyzer
              over time according to their mobility (K). Though TIMS has
              achieved a high level of performance (R > 250) in a small device
              (<5 cm) using modest operating potentials (<300 V), a proper
              theory has yet to be produced. Here, we develop a quantitative
              theory for TIMS via mathematical derivation and simulations. A
              one-dimensional analytical model, used to predict the transit
              time and theoretical resolving power, is described. Theoretical
              trends are in agreement with experimental measurements performed
              as a function of K, pressure, and the axial electric field scan
              rate. The linear dependence of the transit time with 1/K provides
              a fundamental basis for determination of reduced mobility or
              collision cross section values by calibration. The quantitative
              description of TIMS provides an operational understanding of the
              analyzer, outlines the current performance capabilities, and
              provides insight into future avenues for improvement.",

              the analysis of the resulting data, however, there is yet to be
              any tool that mediates the path from raw data to modern ML
              applications. More specifically, ML applications are currently
              hampered by three major limitations: (1) absence of balanced
              training data with large sample size; (2) unclear definition of
              sufficiently information-rich data representations for e.g.,
              peptide identification; (3) lack of benchmarking of ML methods on
              specific LC-MS problems. RESULTS: We created the MS2AI pipeline
              that automates the process of gathering vast quantities of mass
              spectrometry (MS) data for large scale ML applications. The
              software retrieves raw data from either in-house sources or from
              the proteomics identifications database, PRIDE. Subsequently, the
              raw data is stored in a standardized format amenable for ML,
              encompassing MS1/MS2 spectra and peptide identifications. This
              tool bridges the gap between MS and AI, and to this effect we

              neural network for the identification of oxidized peptides.

              retrieve the files and metadata associated with a project when
              provided its identifier. To demonstrate how ppx enhances
              reproducible research, we used ppx within a Snakemake workflow to
              reanalyze a published data set with the open modification search
              tool ANN-SoLo and compared our reanalysis to the original
              results. We show that ppx readily integrates into workflows, and
              our reanalysis produced results consistent with the original
              analysis. We envision that ppx will be a valuable tool for
              creating reproducible analyses, providing tool developers easy
              access to data for development, testing, and benchmarking, and
              enabling the use of mass spectrometry data in data-intensive
              analyses. The ppx package is freely available and open source

  abstract = "Traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TW IMS) is a new IMS
              method implemented in the Synapt IMS/mass spectrometry system
              (Waters). Despite its wide adoption, the foundations of TW IMS
              were only qualitatively understood and factors governing the ion
              transit time (the separation parameter) and resolution remained
              murky. Here we develop the theory of TW IMS using derivations and
              ion dynamics simulations. The key parameter is the ratio (c) of
              ion drift velocity at the steepest wave slope to wave speed. At
              low c, the ion transit velocity is proportional to the squares of
              mobility (K) and electric field intensity (E), as opposed to
              linear scaling in drift tube (DT) IMS and differential mobility
              analyzers. At higher c, the scaling deviates from quadratic in a
              way controlled by the waveform profile, becoming more gradual
              with the ideal triangular profile but first steeper and then more
              gradual for realistic profiles with variable E. At highest c, the
              transit velocity asymptotically approaches the wave speed. Unlike
              with DT IMS, the resolving power of TW IMS depends on mobility,
              scaling as K(1/2) in the low-c limit and less at higher c. A
              nonlinear dependence of the transit time on mobility means that
              the true resolving power of TW IMS differs from that indicated by
              the spectrum. A near-optimum resolution is achievable over an
              approximately 300-400\% range of mobilities. The major predicted
              trends are in agreement with TW IMS measurements for peptide ions
              as a function of mobility, wave amplitude, and gas pressure. The
              issues of proper TW IMS calibration and ion distortion by field
              heating are also discussed. The new quantitative understanding of
              TW IMS separations allows rational optimization of instrument
              design and operation and improved spectral calibration.",

              continuous improvements in PRIDE Archive data pipelines and

              provide direct access to the submitted mass spectra using

              remove peptide identification ambiguity in complex liquid
              chromatography-mass spectrometry identification workflows.
              However, due to the way peptides are encoded in current
              prediction models, accurate retention times cannot be predicted
              for modified peptides. This is especially problematic for
              fledgling open searches, which will benefit from accurate
              retention time prediction for modified peptides to reduce
              identification ambiguity. We present DeepLC, a deep learning
              peptide retention time predictor using peptide encoding based on
              atomic composition that allows the retention time of (previously
              unseen) modified peptides to be predicted accurately. We show
              that DeepLC performs similarly to current state-of-the-art
              approaches for unmodified peptides and, more importantly,
              accurately predicts retention times for modifications not seen
              during training. Moreover, we show that DeepLC's ability to
              predict retention times for any modification enables potentially
              incorrect identifications to be flagged in an open search of a

  abstract     = {MS²PIP is a data-driven tool that accurately predicts peak intensities for a given peptide's fragmentation mass spectrum. Since the release of the (MSPIP)-P-2 web server in 2015, we have brought significant updates to both the tool and the web server. In addition to the original models for CID and HCD fragmentation, we have added specialized models for the TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer, for TMT-labeled peptides, for iTRAQ-labeled peptides, and for iTRAQ-labeled phosphopeptides. Because the fragmentation pattern is heavily altered in each of these cases, these additional models greatly improve the prediction accuracy for their corresponding data types. We have also substantially reduced the computational resources required to run (MSPIP)-P-2, and have completely rebuilt the web server, which now allows predictions of up to 100 000 peptide sequences in a single request.
